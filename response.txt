Running the linear regression example, halts (command prompt does not return) on 

from bayespy.nodes import GaussianARD

when I do 

from bayespy.nodes import GaussianARD, Gamma

the command prompt responds with

SOMETHING


This is a nasty bug in matplotlib 1.4.0 and BayesPy tries to use a

So, this should work if you install matplotlib!=1.4.0.
