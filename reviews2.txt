As you can see from the reviews we are almost there in terms of acceptance. The
tidying up required (minor revision) is to: resolve the different factorisation
issue (reviewer 1), make the typographic changes suggested in the linked pdf
file and ensure that the install is smooth as suggested by reviewer 2.

So, well done for improving the first version to this point, I am confident that
you will be able to address the minor issues fairly rapidly.


REVIEWER 1
==========

The new manuscript is improved, although still not perfect.  It has addressed
the lack of comparison to other systems by giving the performance of the system
on two standard models compared to Infer.NET.  It is not clear why the authors
used different factorisations for the Infer.NET models in this comparison, since
this allows one system to use efficient matrix operations whilst the other
cannot.  This could be having a significant effect on computation time.

A real world example and a more complete list of the supported nodes are still
lacking, but at least the reader can get some sense of what can be done with the
system and how quickly.

Overall, it's a better manuscript, and probably just good enough for acceptance.
I do still feel that there is room for improvement and would like the
different-factorisation issue to be addressed before publication.



REVIEWER 3
==========

The revision is improved. Here is an edited version with only a few language
suggestions:

One minor software issue: the example in the manuscript fails at the plotting
step (line 18) when using either the pip version or the current Github source. I
recommend making the entire example compatible with the current version
installed by pip.
